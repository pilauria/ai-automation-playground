# AI Automation Playground — Learning Log

This repository tracks my structured journey into AI development, automation, and agent-based systems. 
The goal is simple: build enough practical skill to deliver real automation value fast.

## 🔥 What I'm Learning
A focused path across:
- AI fundamentals and model interaction
- Automation tooling (n8n, Make, LangChain, custom scripts)
- AI agents (planning, tool use, execution flows)
- Practical integrations (APIs, webhooks, workflows)

## 📂 Repository Structure
/experiments  
 Small, isolated tests exploring tools, APIs, models, and techniques.

/workflows  
 Automation builds using n8n, Make.com, or custom orchestration.

/agents  
 Agent prototypes, planners, tool definitions, and execution logic.

/notes  
 Short technical writeups summarizing concepts I've learned.

/resources  
 Useful references, snippets, prompts, or configs.

## 🧪 Current Progress
- [ ] First automation workflow  
- [ ] First local or cloud-based AI agent  
- [ ] API integration tests (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, etc.)  
- [ ] Reusable Python scripts for orchestrating tasks  
- [ ] Draft documentation for scripts and workflows  

I'm updating this section as I build.

## 🎯 Short-Term Objectives
1. Build a stable environment for running scripts and agents.  
2. Create a few end-to-end automations showcasing real scenarios.  
3. Document reusable patterns for AI-enhanced workflow design.

## 🚀 Long-Term Direction
- Develop reliable automation modules.  
- Build agent-based systems capable of tool use and decision-making.  
- Prepare client-ready templates and examples.
